### How to install
#### Easy

1. Install [Downloader by AFTVnews](https://www.aftvnews.com/downloader/) from [Google Play](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.esaba.downloader) or [Amazon app store](https://www.amazon.co.uk/dp/B01N0BP507)
2. Use this URL inside the Downloader app: **https://bit.ly/S0und-TV** and download the apk
3. Install the app, launch it, and it will prompt you to update S0undTV itself so you have the latest version. 

#### "Difficult" 
- download and sideload the latest apk to your device


### Is there a difference between the 'Standalone' and the 'Google Play' versions?
- Yes, the Standalone version (hosted here on Github) has its own updating system. So once you install the app, you will receive automatic updates just like you would using the app installed from Google Play.
- Updates are faster because I don't have to wait for Google to approve an update.
- Beta versions are only published through the 'Standalone' version.
